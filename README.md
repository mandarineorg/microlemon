A collection of microservices with a common interface for [Deno](https://deno.land) by [Mandarine](https://deno.land/x/mandarinets).

------------

## Description
Microlemon is a collection of implementation of microservices for Deno. Currently, Microlemon has support for:
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) through AMQP
- [REDIS](https://redis.io/)
- [NATS](https://nats.io/)

## Status
The final goal of Microlemon is to have a collection of multiple microservices which would all work under the same interface & methods and while this goal is currently implemented, it is not fully integrated. This project keeps its status under construction though able to be used in both small & large projects.
